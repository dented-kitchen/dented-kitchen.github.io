# Pantry
Pantry is a free, open-source set of Ingredient, Equipment and Technique data for use with Replicake. It is the fastest way to get started authoring recipes, but it is NOT required to use Replicake as this data can be embedded directly into Recipes themselves. It is also possible to bring your own data.

Contributions to Pantry are greatly appreciated.
